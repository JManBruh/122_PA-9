** This assigment was made by Jordan Baker, @hypernon, and Aiden Cook. But not really. 
** The reason there's no physics is because I've spent 35 hours coding everything else - the batch renderer, 
** then the tilemap, the map generation, and just generally figuring out everything.  
** Aiden contributed the music you hear, and @hypernon gave me 5 sprites. That's about it. 
** I am not above slandering my teammates, especially when I put a work-schedule's worth of time into something 
** and we still fail because no one else coded. How you handle this is up to you, Korbin. I just wanted to 
** explain why we don't have a working game. There is no movement - they said they'd work on it, but never did.
** And please... don't tell them I said this? Thanks.
